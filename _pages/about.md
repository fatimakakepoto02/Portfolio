Welcome to my portfolio website! This site is built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Front End/Full Stack Developer. I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for creating user-centric digital solutions and optimising business processes through innovative, data-driven approaches.

I have a strong foundation in web development, database management, and programming, with hands-on experience in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ReactJS, NodeJS), PHP, SQL, and more. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to solve complex problems and continuously learn new technologies.

I am always eager to connect and collaborate! You can reach me at:
